> This directory is for the first homework assignment from 15th of November 2024 till the 5th of December 2024.

# Homework 1
This is your first assignment of the Data Mining and Machine learning course. You submit this assignment as a group of up to 4 people. You can submit this assignment up to 100 times, the last submission will be the one who counts. The assignment is auto-graded via numerical questions. All questions have a margin of 0.005, that is, if you round your answer to at least two decimals after the point, then your answer will be counted as correct. Note that there will be no partial points given for answers with a rounding error, that are otherwise correct. You don't need to round your result if you want to be safe, but if you do, we assume that you know how. Further please note that the log‚Å°log indicates the natural logarithm throughout this course (the one to basis ee). Please be aware that switching groups for the same assignment will be difficult in ANS. So, don't submit the assignment before you are in your final group. 

## Structure
Each question in ANS gets it's own notebook. These are all very self explanatory. `question-1.ipynb` is for question 1, `question-2.ipynb` is for question 2, etc. In there the question is copied from ANS and there are code blocks in between where we work on the exercises described below.
